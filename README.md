# Pacmen
## Description
In this project we are going to create a PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace. It was a fun and challenge project!.
## How to run
We will create two buttons. The first one (add pacman) will add a single pacman to the screen. This pacman will get a random position in the screen and then you will press the second button (start game) in order to start moving. the pacman will move in random direction and random velocity. You can add infinite number of pacmen and also the star button will make they goes faster and faster.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I will add some background color to the sreen and also try to get a set of images of pacmen in different colors then any pacman could be any random color possible.
